# Tic-Tac-Toe-Squared

This game is a twist on Tic Tac Toe that makes the game more challenging and fun. You play a Tic Tac Toe game in each of the 9 squares of a regular Tic Tac Toe game.

This game is Android only, and the play store entry is available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diusrex.tictactoe).

I found the boxes background image from http://opengameart.org/content/117-stone-wall-tilable-textures-in-8-themes.

Future
------------
I plan on implementing multiple AIs in the game that run using different algorithms/stategies such as including minimax, Alphaâ€“beta pruning, and Monte Carlo tree search.
As well, I will also improve the layout for tablets, 

# To Run

All you need to run is Android Studio, and an Android API that is compatible with this program.
